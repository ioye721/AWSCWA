        <p>
        This continuous deployment pipeline utilizes AWS CodePipeline to automatically build and deploy your application to your desired environment. CodePipeline handles the entire release process, starting from the source code repository to the production environment, ensuring that your application is always up-to-date and running the latest code.

With this setup, you can:

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Accelerate the release process by automating the build and deployment steps</li>
            <li>Maintain a consistent and reliable release process by following the best practices and guidelines established in your pipeline</li>
            <li>Ensure that your application is always running the latest code, reducing the risk of security vulnerabilities and ensuring that your customers have access to the latest features and bug fixes</li>
        </ul>
